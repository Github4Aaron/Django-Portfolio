## django-personal-portfolio
This personal portfolio was built using the Python framework Django and it showcases various technologies with which I have worked. 


## Acknowledgments & Motivation
This project was based upon the Lynda.com tutorial "Building a Personal Portfolio with Django" and this was my first time using Python.   Included in this project was working with Python models, a Postgres database, static files, and the Django adminstration portal.
